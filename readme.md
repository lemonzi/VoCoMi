VoCoMi
======

VoCoMi (Voice-Commanded Mixer) is a hack submitted at the WearHacks Montreal 2015 Hackathon. It is a music sequencer for visually impaired people that does not require any visual feedback to be operated.

The system prompts input to the user using Nuance's TTS engine, and it understand voice commands through Nuance's speech recognition and understanding API's. Once a sample bank is selected, the user can browse its contents with gestures using the Myo armband and compose with them using a loop machine.
